<p>UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has had a successful week. He can celebrate this success. Despite the good news on the economic front, those close to the UK Prime Minister say they have reminded Rishi Sunak that his castle is built on sand.</p>



<p>The good news for the UK is that, as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said this week, the UK is not on the path to recession. Inflation and fuel prices are falling in the country. But this rate is much better than what Rishi Sunak wanted.</p>



<p>All is not well in the UK yet. But Rishi Sunak&#8217;s predecessor, Liz Truss, blundered and made economic gambles that saw the pound hit its lowest level against the dollar in a decade. Rishi Sunak can claim to have steadied the wobbly ship somewhat in the turbulent situation he took over from his predecessor.</p>



<p>But the bad news for Rishi Sunak is that his party, the Conservative Party, is still deeply divided. Various issues are still not discussed among the party members. They are fighting against each other on various issues.</p>



<p>It has not been a year since UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson was prime minister and was fighting to hold on to power in Downing Street despite scandals. During the corona epidemic, he broke the rules and threw a party. Rishi Sunak was then his Chancellor (Finance Minister). He was the one who left the cabinet after knowing the scandal of Boris Johnson and dealt a severe blow to Boris Johnson&#8217;s power.</p>



<p>Johnson&#8217;s closest allies never forgave Sunak for that betrayal. When Liz Truss stood against Sunak to take over from Boris Johnson, they all backed Liz. But Leez was forced to resign after only 49 days in power. As a result, there were no more rivals for Sunak. He became Prime Minister of the United Kingdom on October 25 last year and took an anti-lease position.</p>



<p>Rishi Sunak brought relations with Europe to a more flexible position. Johnson and Truss distanced themselves from conservatives close to them. According to the conservative right, Rishi Sunak betrayed the principle.</p>



<p>This is why Rishi has become weak in the internal politics of the Conservative Party. Two things happened this week that reminded some conservatives how quickly things can turn around.</p>



<p>The first is that Rishi has decided what to do with Home Minister Suella Braverman. Suella admitted that he sought the help of civil servants to avoid being fined for speeding in the car. Sunak ruled that Suella&#8217;s actions did not break the cabinet code. But he had to resign from the cabinet for breaking the law. Sunak quickly protected him. Because, Sunak knows he is weak to Suella. He can&#8217;t fight Zuela. Many who do not like him are with Zuela.</p>



<p>Earlier last week, Braverman spoke at an anti-Sunak conference in London. He wants to lead the Conservative Party in the future. Therefore, Suella Braverman presented her statement on that platform without paying attention to Sunak&#8217;s words.</p>



<p>The second thing is, back to Boris Johnson&#8217;s discussion. According to reports that Boris Johnson broke the rules during Corona, the matter is more serious than that. Police say Johnson broke more laws than it turned out. Boris&#8217;s allies did not take it well. They blame Sunak for this. They allege that he is behind everything. However, Rishi Sunak&#8217;s spokesperson denied the allegation.</p>



<p>Just like that two people can make Sunak&#8217;s life very difficult. They can distract from the positive headlines about the UK economy and remind everyone how quickly the Conservative Party can be divided among themselves.</p>



<p>Some of Rishi Sunak&#8217;s allies criticized Sunak for bringing Braverman to important government positions. He once had to resign from the Trus government for violating the ministerial code. Everyone knows about his ambition. Braverman is the first to step down from the ministry before the next election to take any top leadership position. If the Conservative Party loses power, that situation may also occur.</p>



<p>A senior Conservative MP told CNN that Rishi Sunak came to power knowing he was weak. He knows that he is not as strong as Boris Johnson and Liz.</p>



<p>The member added that the reality is that a very weak person like Sunak has already done a lot of damage to the party. He can step out of the shadow of Boris or Liege and form a government of his own. But his lack of confidence made them stronger in the long run.</p>



<p>A former Conservative Party adviser said if the polls did not improve, the risk of a landslide could increase. If the MPs start thinking that they cannot win the next election, some of them will decide to leave the party. The image that the party has built up for so long will crumble.</p>



<p>If a party wants to come to power, party unity is very important. Among UK political parties, the Conservative Party has historically been the most cohesive. But a senior party adviser said, &#8216;There is no hope in hell.&#8217; He commented that there is no option but to show unity like in the past before going to the next election.</p>



<p>The election consultant said, &#8216;We choose someone from the top for leadership. But if someone like Braverman is already thinking about the next leadership race, it will set a bad precedent for what&#8217;s going to happen in the next election.&#8217;</p>



<p>Rishi Sunak came to power promising a more professional approach to government. This was not seen in the previous three years in the UK. His slow and steady management style could increase votes. At the moment, no one is seriously considering trying to remove him from office.</p>



<p>Again, no one thinks that there will be an overnight change in the UK or that Boris Johnson will return to power. Many people want Rishi Sunak to remain in charge until the next election. Many people want the economy to be strengthened by his hand. But the fear is that the ugly form of the Conservative Party will begin to emerge. This will bring back factionalism and result in electoral defeat.</p>



<p>Members of the Conservative Party have been reminded of this this week. The modern Conservative Party is three steps away from collapse, an MP has said.</p>
